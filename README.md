## Experiemental Setting
DenseNet100-12 from scratch <br>
- number of convolutional layers: 100 <br>
- growth rate = 12  <br>
- used on Cifar10, Cifar100 and SVHN datasets [git repo on densenet](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet/blob/master/LICENSE)
- implemented using keras
- pretrained weights
